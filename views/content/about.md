The accessibility clock is tickling for European Accessibility act to take effect. 

This agenda proposes to build a  timeline from the adoption (2019) to it's entry into force (2025). 

It aims to help identify ressources and lists of ressources. 

It does not pretend to be complet, any element you wish to add can be submited thru the [Form Add Event](form.md).
