[The directive's text on the European union law website](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32019L0882).

* (41): *E-book files are based on a electronic computer coding that enables the circulation and consultation of a mostly textual and graphical intellectual work. The degree of precision of this coding determines the accessibility of e-book files, in particular regarding the qualification of the different constitutive elements of the work and the standardised description of its structure. The interoperability in terms of accessibility should optimise the compatibility of those files with the user agents and with current and future assistive technologies. Specific features of special volumes like comics, childrenâ€™s books and art books should be considered in the light of all applicable accessibility requirements. Divergent accessibility requirements in Member States would make it difficult for publishers and other economic operators to benefit from the advantages of the internal market, could create interoperability problems with e-readers and would limit the access for consumers with disabilities. In the context of e-books, the concept of a service provider could include publishers and other economic operators involved in their distribution.*

* Section IV (f) points additional accessibility requirements related to digital book as services.
  * (i)ensuring that, when an e-book contains audio in addition to text, it then provides synchronised text and audio;
  * (ii) ensuring that e-book digital files do not prevent assistive technology from operating properly;
  * (iii)ensuring access to the content, the navigation of the file content and layout including dynamic layout, the provision of the structure, flexibility and choice in the presentation of the content;
  * (iv) allowing alternative renditions of the content and its interoperability with a variety of assistive technologies, in such a way that it is perceivable, understandable, operable and robust;
  * (v) making them discoverable by providing information through metadata about their accessibility features;
  * (vi) ensuring that digital rights management measures do not block accessibility features.

* Section IV (g) points additional accessibility requirements related to E-Commerce services.
  * (i)providing the information concerning accessibility of the products and services being sold when this information is provided by the responsible economic operator;
  * (ii)ensuring the accessibility of the functionality for identification, security and payment when delivered as part of a service instead of a product by making it perceivable, operable, understandable and robust;
  * (iii)providing identification methods, electronic signatures, and payment services which are perceivable, operable, understandable and robust.
