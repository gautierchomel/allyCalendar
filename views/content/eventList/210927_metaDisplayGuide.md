User Experience Guide for Displaying Accessibility Metadata 1.0 is a final Community Group report by
[Publishing Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/publishingcg/)](<https://www.w3.org/community/publishingcg/>).

It comes with [Display Techniques for EPUB](https://www.w3.org/publishing/a11y/UX-Guide-metadata/techniques/epub-metadata/index.html) and [Display Techniques for ONIX].

Publishing Community Group asked for feedbacks. Implementation projects have started in different places including France (EDRLab) and Italy (LIA Foundazione).
